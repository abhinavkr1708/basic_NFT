# basic-NFT
Built and deployed basic NFT using Hardhat and OZ libraries for ERC 721 type contracts. <br />
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.<br/>
The token can be viewed by copying the following address and searching on Goerli Etherscan:
```shell
